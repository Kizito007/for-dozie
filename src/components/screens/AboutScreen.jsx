                My name is Nwaka Chiedozie Mario and I'm passionate about improving the everyday lives of others through 
                design. I'm constantly learning new things everyday and love meeting people who are motivated and unafraid 
                to explore and share their ideas with the world. <br/><br/>
                I'm a self taught designer and have learnt a lot of the processes, concepts and theories of UX/UI and product 
                design through attending workshops, design challenges, reading blogs and applying these to projects in my 
                spare time and at work. I am very much a big-picture thinker and enjoy working on products end to end, from 
                rom ideation all the way to development. <br/><br/>

                    Wonder can I get along with the, team? Here is me during spare time:
                </h2>
                <p>
                I create NFTs (visual designs) and pencil portrait art during my spare time, Yea! Design is a life-long passion. 
                I view the goal of design as a better quality of human life, either functionally or aesthetically. . I am 
                fascinated by beautiful environments, creatures, and human-input. I am a continual observer of the world 
                around me, I try to interpret all the messages behind the physical things that we see everyday. I also stay 
                current on the latest trends in design, both social and aesthetic. I prefer subtle over loud, like my personality <br/>
